# Deep Learning Practice ‚Äì Binary Classification Model

This repository contains a practice deep learning project implemented in PyTorch and Jupyter Notebook.  
The model was trained to classify samples into two categories: **Sus** and **Not Sus**.

---

## üìå Project Overview
- Built a simple feed-forward neural network using PyTorch.  
- Trained the model with a training set, validated on a held-out validation set.  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Goal: practice workflow from data preprocessing ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí metrics visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.9+  
- PyTorch  
- TorchMetrics  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook (via VS Code extension)

## Evaluation inference:
   The model has great recall, but terrible precision; it rarely misses a true "Sus", but almost all its "Sus" predictions are wrong. 
   This is because of dataset imbalance which was left unaddressed.
